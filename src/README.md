Version %%VERSION%% (%%DATE%%)

Author: Nicola L. C. Talbot [dickimaw-books.com](https://www.dickimaw-books.com/)

Home Page: https://github.com/nlct/datatool-regions

Required Packages:
[datatool](https://ctan.org/pkg/datatool) (3.0+),
[tracklang](https://ctan.org/pkg/tracklang) (1.6.4+)
 

The `datatool-regions` bundle provides the language-independent
region ldf files for the `datatool` package (v3.0+).
The `*.ldf` files should all be placed on TeX's path.

These files don't require any explicit loading. They will
automatically be input by `datatool-base.sty` (or relevant
supplementary package) if they are found and required by the
`tracklang` localisation settings. See the `datatool` and `tracklang` user
manuals for further details.

The region files deal with defining (if applicable) the currency
symbol and switching to the region's currency in the captions hook.
Region files may additionally (if not dependent on the language) set
the number group and decimal characters and parsing numeric dates
and times.

The language support is distributed separately. Any setting that
depends on _both_ language and region should be supplied with the
applicable language bundle. This may occur for regions with multiple
official languages, where the number formatting or date/time parsing
depends on the language within the region. For example, `datatool-english`
provides `datatool-en-CA.ldf` and `datatool-en-ZA.ldf` in addition
to `datatool-english.ldf`.

If a pre-3.0 version of `datatool` is installed, these ldf files
will be ignored.

Example:
```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[locales={en-GB}]{datatool-base}% v3.0
\begin{document}
Currency: \DTLdecimaltocurrency{1234.56}{\result}\result.
\end{document}
```
If `datatool-regions` is correctly installed, the result will be:

 > Currency: Â£1,234.56.

In most cases the language and region are not inter-connected.
This means that you would get the same result for the above with
`locales={cy-GB}`, `locales={gd-GB}`, `locales={ga-GB}`,
`locales={sco-GB}`, or simply `locales={GB}.`
